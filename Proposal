# Project 5 Proposal

# For this project I am leaning more to the idea of a Location Guessing Game (Choice 16)
# I will provide a display grid and a fixed number of turns like the directions for the examples shown
# One thing I do want to change is the way the game works
# Instead of have having obstacle to find, I want to make the grid like a maze 
# If the wrong square is picked you will have to restart and remember the pattern you have begun to discover
# If you have restarted too many times it will be game over and a new pattern for the maze will be made for the new game.
